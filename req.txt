Features:
  1. Create two inputs and a button to get user input.
		The first one is for "item" and the second is for "price".
		Once the button is clicked, the item data should be added to a display list (like the one in todos).
  2. Create a component to display the min and max prices among all items (not for each individual item).
  3. Introduce a third input for "shop" of every item.
  4. Display the min and max price for every item along with the respective shop name.
  5. Limit the possible inputs for items and shops, through config.
  6. Replace both item and shop inputs with select boxes.
